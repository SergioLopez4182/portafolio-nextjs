# 🚀 Personal Portfolio – Projects Showcase

This repository contains the source code of my personal portfolio website, where I showcase selected professional projects I’ve worked on as a Full Stack Developer.

⚠️ **Note:** The projects presented here do not include their original source code, as it belongs to the companies I worked for. This portfolio focuses on describing the architecture, challenges, responsibilities, and results of each project. 
I will progressively add independent demo implementations where possible.
